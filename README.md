# Incremental_Self-Organization_of_Spatio-Temporal_Spike_Pattern_Detection

This repository contains the codes to implement the model described in the manuscript "Incremental Self-Organization of Spatio-Temporal Spike Pattern Detection".

**Single post-synaptic neuron**
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation for the single postsynaptic neuron simulations described in the paper.

Core files:
Model_One_With_PreHSP.m: This script serves as the main driver for the simulation. It contains the core logic needed to run the model.

Subfunctions:
Model_Input.m and Model_Input_test.m: These subfunctions are responsible for calculating the primary input to the model for learning and testing.

**More than one post-synaptic neuron (Incremental Learning)**
